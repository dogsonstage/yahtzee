# Yahtzee 

This is a text based game of Yahtzee with some basic GUI elements. All functions are performed within the command prompt.

This is a personal project, so I will not be accepting any pull requests. If you wish for any changes to be made, please see below.

### How to Play
The easiest way is to execute the Yahtzee.jar file. 

1. Make sure you have JDK installed. Downloads can be found [here] (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk22-windows).
2. Open cmd and enter 
'''java
-jar [path]/Yahtzee.jar
'''
3. Enjoy your game!

### Future Updates
- [x] Playable Game
- [ ] Gameplay in dedicated window (no more cmd!)
- [ ] Customized visuals (bye bye default white)


### Bugs/Issues/Suggestions

Found a bug? Every game is saved to the file 'debug_log.txt', so it can be easier to find the source of the problem. Here's what to do:

1. Make sure you properly quit the game (enter 'quit' and confirm, don't just close cmd). When you do this, debug_log.txt will include both players' scores at the moment the game quits. This makes it easy to track incorrect scoring.
2. Open a new issue and attach debug_log.txt (it might take some searching, so it would be faster to just use the search bar).
3. Add the appropriate label.
4. Describe the problem and what led up to it.

Since this is a solo project, I will address them as they come as best I can.
